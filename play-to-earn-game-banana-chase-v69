BananaChase_vx.69 	
	The proposed game mechanics create a feedback loop; which creates value within the ecosystem, 
as well as keeps the experience fun to play w/ the community…
Game Mechanics - Banana must run away from the Monkey that is chasing him around the Mad-Lands Forest. The MBU_Vx must navigate thru a mini-maze in order to get to the other end of the land plot…..
	This is where banana trees are growing bananas of different ripeness (madness)... 
the MBU_Vx goes upto each of these trees and presses a button to shake down the growing bananas, 
which then fall to the ground and aid in the fight back against the monkey, which turns the tables… 
	This makes the final achievement of the game, driving the monkey to retreat back all the way to the start point, 
or by damaging it to an ultimate defeat...(different outcomes may be created)
Model Design - BananaTree_Maze 
Budgeting – ETH, $SAND and Txn fees, as well as human capital and skilled labor will be needed to develop this into a reality. 
	These resources should be sourced and allocated within the community’s operations /revenue streams / pooled talent / etc.
