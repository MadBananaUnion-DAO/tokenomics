					Eco-System Tokenomics in the $MAD-Circular-Economy 
			A Possible Structure for the Tokenomics, Mechanics, and Decentralized Finance
Fungible Tokens
	ERC20 -$MAD 
-formed from the fractionalized vault of MBU originals 
- used to purchase MBU from the fractionalized pool 1 $MAD = 1 MBU 
-can be swapped for ETH 
	ERC20 -xMAD 
-reward for staking MBU_3d
-reward for play to earn game
- Governance token for MBU DAO and voting on proposals, token gated snapshot 
-can be swapped for $MAD
Non-Fungible Tokens
	ERC721 - MBU # 
(original minted 6,969 pfp NFTs)
	MBU staked for $MAD 
	ERC271 - MBU_3d # 
(2nd drop by community, 4,200 avatars to use ANY game) 
 	MBU_vx staked for xMAD 
Liquidty Provider- AMM POOLS
	$MAD/ETH  --> liquidty pool formed in accordance with NFTx.io fractionalization, 
		ACHIEVES the a fungible link between the MBU's floor price, the ERC20 $MAD tokens represents THAT specific pool of bananas, 
		tied to the total floor price on marketplaces...
		which will change over time that bananas in the vault are bought, staked, swapped, sold into, arbirtraged, etc) 
		Arbritrage.....if bananas are selling for higher on open market, 
		than banana in the fractionalized pool will be bought
			vice versa if bananas are selling for higher in fractionalized pool, 
		then bananas on open market will be bought...this inherently makes $MAD act the same way 
		and move in relation to ETH price as the floor price of MBU moves)
	xMAD/$MAD --> 
		liqudity pool on sushiswap (on Polygon L2). 
		collecting fees on members(or contracts) swapping xMAD to $MAD. 
		LP tokens can have other utlities. 
	$MAD/$SAND --> 
		liqudiuty pool for rewarding SANDBOX players and SANDBOX stakers. 
	xMAD / MBU_vx --> 
		renting pool for avatar games and avatar access. 
		---ALL pools will be collecting Txn fees, and all holders of the LP Tokens get distributed these funds in porportion to their 		holdings of the LP Tokens and % of Supply of the AMM Trading Pool (These AMM's work much differently than an order book)---
Possbile loops of Eonomic Motion...of the Banana Ocean 
	1$MAD = 1MBU = ?ETH
	1MBU_3d = 1$MAD = ?ETH
		this is the key...& the floor... 
-->CLOSED economic circuit that the rest of this branches off from.....
	THE FLOOR PRICES of the MBU and MBU_3d will fluctuate by way of the interactions between the different elements of the eco-system 
get xMAD --> swap for $MAD --> buy MBU --> sell for ETH -->get xMAD for Txn reward
get xMAD --> swap for $MAD --> buy MBU_3d --> use in game
get xMAD --> hold for governance 
get $MAD --> stake and compound --> swap earnings for ETH 
get $MAD --> buy 1 MBU
get $MAD --> swap for $SAND
get $MAD --> buy MBU_3d 
stake $MAD get xMAD 
stake MBU_vx --> get xMAD
play game --> get xMAD 
stake MBU (unlisted MBU) --> get $MAD
burn $MAD --> ('breed') get MBU_3d 
	The Creation and usage of $MAD reduces the MBU supply available to purchase which increases the ETH value for each MBU
so we increase utility of $MAD and drive the demand to take MBU off the market, contributing to the feedback loop. 
				Txn fees within MBU eco-ecosystem
	All the above essentially creates the value flow as well as the market stability 
needed to create the feedback loop between assets, tokens, particpation, and  the overall $MAD economy
format for cricular economic equations should always end with the first variable of the equatution
essentially provbiding a proof for the circular nature of these flows of values and actions. 
	X = Y = Z = X = Y = Z 
xMAD potential for a governance token for DAO participation 
your a 'n' integer could be a derivative of xMAD, 
which can achieve some form of EMISSION per block mechanic....
	this is risky of an inflationary environment 
	which potentially debases any value that is created 
	unless it is created to outpace it as demand drivers ramp up.... 
	so maybe this is formed after the circuits are flowing, if not, 
	if may stop the circuits from properly engaging these mechanics simultaneously.
	that being there many ways in which this can / will / does create value, 
	the timing the input of a DAO-derivative is crucially important .... 
	as governing bodies that create their own inflation (to pay things to get done) 
	without backing to the economic circuitry are non-sustainable in the long run and MBU lives on forever !!! 
	the value must always be tied back to the assets growth within the network, 
	as well as the direct path of those assets to exit in ETH 
	the fixed supply of the MBU assets will rise in value, each time, their is an increased amount of users / holders / investors 			(preferably in waves)....]the rise in value is due to the nature of the Network Affect paired with Circular Economic Structure and of 	course the Law of Supply and Demand
